Simple pie chart drawer
======

I needed something like this recently. Since I couldn't find anything that worked good enough I decided to create my own script to draw simple animated pie charts.

The pie charts are created using pure css (thanks to this [CSS3 Pie Chart article from Atomic Noggin](http://atomicnoggin.ca/blog/2010/02/20/pure-css3-pie-charts/).) and animated with css `transition` and `transform`. A simple js function automates it and makes it easy to customize.

Any feedback will be welcome!
